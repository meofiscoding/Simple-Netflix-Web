## Introduction

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This project is a simplified Netflix-inspired platform built to help you learn TypeScript, Angular, MongoDB, and ASP.NET Web API. In this README, you'll find information on setting up and running the project, as well as an overview of its features and technologies used.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login functionality.
- **Streaming:** Watch movies and TV shows with a built-in video player.
- **Movie Management:** Users can save and manage their favorite movies.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for movies and TV shows by title or genre.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **ASP.NET Web API:** A framework for building HTTP services in C#.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js 16.x: You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB: Install and configure MongoDB on your system. You can download it from [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/).
- Angular CLI: Install globally using npm: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code: For C# and ASP.NET development.
- (Other prerequisites as needed)
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
